# Kinematic-Flow

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks that provide details of the differential equations for cosmological correlators of conformally coupled scalars in a power-law cosmology. The provided notebooks cover examples ranging from two-site to four-site graphs.

For more information, see [Differential Equations for Cosmological Correlators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05303) and [Kinematic Flow and the Emergence of Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05300).
